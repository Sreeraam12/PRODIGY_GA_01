Text Generation with GPT-2

# Task-1: Text Generation with GPT-2

This task involves implementing a text generation model using **GPT-2**, a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI. The goal is to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Fine-tune the pre-trained GPT-2 model on a custom dataset
- Generate text that mimics the structure and tone of the training data
- Explore prompt-driven text generation

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Google Colab

## 📁 Contents
- `gpt2_text_generation.ipynb` – Notebook for model fine-tuning and inference
- `sample_output.txt` – Example generated text outputs
- `dataset/` – Custom training dataset 

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Install required dependencies.
3. Upload your dataset or use the default one.
4. Run cells to fine-tune and generate text.

## 📌 Sample Output
> Prompt: "The future of AI is"  
> Generated: "The future of AI is unfolding rapidly, influencing industries, education, and everyday life..."
